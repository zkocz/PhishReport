# PhishReport
This plug-in for Microsoft Office Outlook allows corporate users to forward suspicious e-mail (phishing, spam etc.) to a defined address to validate its legitimacy. The person in charge of validation will receive a copy and headers of the original email.

The project also contains an example of a setup project to create .MSI package.
